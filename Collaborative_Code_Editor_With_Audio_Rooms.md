## Aim

We aim to:
- create a website with a code editor
- users can create a room and others are able to join the room
- voice and video and text chat functions
- the code editor is synced accross the users in a room

## Introduction

Collaborative code editors are very useful in the software industry. They can be used for
pair programming, debugging, interviews, etc.

Currently, we can find a lot of collaborative code editors online. However, there aren’t
many code editors which have a built-in audio feature. In this project, we aim to build a live
code editor and have a feature of audio rooms within the editor. Hence, there won’t be a
need to use a separate tool or device for audio communication with a peer.
