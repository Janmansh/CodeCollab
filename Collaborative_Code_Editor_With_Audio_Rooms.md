## Aim

We aim to:
- create a website with a code editor
- users can create a room and others are able to join the room
- voice and video and text chat functions
- the code editor is synced accross the users in a room

## Introduction

Collaborative code editors are very useful in the software industry. They can be used for
pair programming, debugging, interviews, etc.

Currently, we can find a lot of collaborative code editors online. However, there aren’t
many code editors which have a built-in audio feature. In this project, we aim to build a live
code editor and have a feature of audio rooms within the editor. Hence, there won’t be a
need to use a separate tool or device for audio communication with a peer.

## Frontend

The frontend is what users interact with. This is designed using ReactJS.


## WebRTC

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a free and open-source project providing web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication (RTC) via application programming interfaces (APIs). It allows audio and video communication to work inside web pages by allowing direct peer-to-peer communication, eliminating the need to install plugins or download native apps

## Backend Server

For handling of adding users to different rooms and initiating the first
connection we have used golang to build a server.
